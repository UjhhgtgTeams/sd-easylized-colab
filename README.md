# Stable Diffusion Easylized
**The code in this repo is outdated. Find up-to-date code in the link below.**<br>
Want to try out Stable Diffusion but your computer is potato? Don't worry, because this repo is here to help. "Borrow" Google's Colab servers and run it there.

## Usage
1. Open [this code on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HuyJTnfaSnzqLEwe8Pvs3KyKHw--ULin).
2. Log in to your Google account.
3. Tweak the options.
4. Click Runtime->Run all in the menu bar.
5. Wait until a link pops up below the whole page and open it. (It may took a few ten seconds for the link to be reachable.)

## Known Bugs
[ ] It takes years for Colab to compile xformers (which is used to speed up image generation) so this procedure is currently disabled.
