# Stable Diffusion Easylized
**The code in this repo may be outdated. Up-to-date code is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HuyJTnfaSnzqLEwe8Pvs3KyKHw--ULin)**<br>
Want to try out Stable Diffusion but your computer is potato? Don't worry, because this repo is here to help. "Borrow" Google's Colab servers and run it there.

## Usage
1. Open [the code on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HuyJTnfaSnzqLEwe8Pvs3KyKHw--ULin).
2. Log in to your Google account.
3. Tweak the options.
4. Click Runtime->Run all in the menu bar.
5. Wait until a link pops up in the code output and open it. (it will take a few ten seconds for the link to be reachable.)

___Running this kind of code with Colab for over an hour is not recommended. Your account may be restricted/banned!___

## Known Bugs
- It takes years for Colab to compile xformers (which is used to speed up image generation) so this procedure is currently disabled.
