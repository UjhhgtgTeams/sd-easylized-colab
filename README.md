# Stable Diffusion Easylized

Want to try out Stable Diffusion but your computer is potato? Don't worry, because this notebook is here to help. "Borrow" Google / Kaggle's servers and run it there.

2. Log in to your Google account.
3. Tweak the options.
4. Click `Runtime->Run All` in the menu bar.
5. (Grant the notebook your Google Drive's access if necessary.)

8. Click `Run All` in the menu bar.
9. Wait until a link pops up in the code output and open it. (it will take a few ten seconds for the link to be reachable.)

## Known Bugs

- It takes years for Colab to compile xformers (which is used to speed up image generation) so this procedure is currently disabled. \
Solution: You can install it from PyPi for now (available in the config).
- Kaggle will not enable GPUs, the Internet, package updates and data persistence for notebooks by default. \
Solution: In the bar on the right, look for `Notebook Options` and set the options as below:

```none
Accelerator: GPU T4 * 2
Language: Python
Persistence: Variables and Files
Environment: Always use latest environment
Internet: On
```

If you couldn't find the options to enable GPUs and the Internet, [verify your phone number](https://www.kaggle.com/settings/account).
