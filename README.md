# Stable Diffusion Easylized

Want to try out Stable Diffusion but your computer is potato? Don't worry, because this notebook is here to help. "Borrow" Google's Colab servers and run it there.

## Usage

### Google Colab

1. Open [the notebook on Google Colab]().
2. Log in to your Google account.
3. Tweak the options.
4. Click `Runtime->Run All` in the menu bar.
(4a. Grant the notebook your Google Drive's access if necessary.)
1. Wait until a link pops up in the code output and open it. (it will take a few ten seconds for the link to be reachable.)

### Kaggle

1. Open [the notebook on Kaggle]().

___Note that this kind of use is currently restricted by Google / Kaggle if you don't have a Pro subscription. Although no bans are planned, your session may be terminated at any time.___

## Known Bugs

- ~It takes years for Colab to compile xformers (which is used to speed up image generation) so this procedure is currently disabled.~
